# Quantum

A very simple and tiny micro framework for web applications using a native template engine and a small database abstraction layer. I wrote it with absolute beginners in mind, as some of my team members are new to PHP. 

## Requirements

* PHP 8.2
* MariaDB 10 or MySQL 8
* PDO

## Installation

As I wanted to keep things as simple as possible, you just need to download the ZIP-File from GitHub and unpack it whereever you like.

## Getting Started

Open your terminal and navigate to the web directory in the project folder using ```cd```. From there, start the PHP server using

```
php -S localhost:8080
```

Go to your browser and open localhost:8080. You should see the default Quantum web page!
